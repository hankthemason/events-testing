Therapeutic Breathwork, or Conscious Breathing is a cyclic, slightly faster than normal breathing pattern that activates our nervous systems and allows us to move things which no longer serve us out of our bodies. It is a powerful tool for trauma healing and for shifting out of chronic feelings of stuck-ness, fatigue and general dis-ease. Breathwork can help with fatigue, anxiety, insomnia, depression as well as many other physical, mental and spiritual ailments. My intention as a facilitator is to empower folks to take ownership over their own healing process and to help usher them through the beautiful, big releases that this practice can offer over time.
Group Breathwork adds a layer of communal experience. We will be setting intentions together and breathing as a group for around 45 minutes. I will be there as a facilitator to answer any questions and guide you through your experience.
Participants are encouraged to bring yoga mats and blankets if they have - though some will be provided. You are also encouraged to bring water, a notebook, and something to write with.
Workshop is sliding scale $20-50
