How does practice unlock discovery and desire?
How do we work with moments of confusion and doubt?
WORKSPACE is a repeated gathering and structured workspace for movement based artists led by choreographer Beth Gill. Through a practice of working, engaging assignments and proposals that consider the craft of choreography from different vantage points we will tune into ourselves and listen for the sparks of curiosity and longing that are guiding our choices. Each three hour workshop will shift between periods of busy, focused working, collective dialoguing and individual reflection and dreaming. Participants should already have a creative practice established for themselves as well as some previous experience with moving/dancing.
