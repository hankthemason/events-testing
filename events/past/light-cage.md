Light Cage examines identity, loss, grief, death, and shapeshifting. It draws from dream logic and embodies the Grand Canyon’s transformation through release. Using a cyclical score, the piece rocks between highly choreographed phrases, sensorial improvisation, and text in its reckoning with notions of time and the changing self~~~~~~
Alisya, Kalliope, Iliana, and Owen are called to move through a journey of energies, sensing, pulsing, measuring, vibrating, sustaining…rhythm and release. Cayleen talks about the Grand Canyon, the ocean, time, fear, fantasy, seeing herself, and rebirth. The dancers return to execute a systematic choreography…glorified form…layers…circles. Cayleen then meets her double and dances a prayer....//////// The piece could repeat itself, but doesn’t.
